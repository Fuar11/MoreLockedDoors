# More Locked Doors
This is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

More Locked Doors adds more locks to many of the game's buildings and doors, making certain key areas more inaccessible.

* More locks added on doors for key areas across Lower Great Bear like the Dam, Quonset Gas Station, Farmhouse, etc...
* Locks require tools like prybars, hacksaws and boltcutters to open. 
* Some locks require specific keys to open.
* Added new item spawns for items to unlock doors with.

## Note for New Saves

* Using this mod on a new save will lock doors at random and may cause you to get stuck in certain locations.
