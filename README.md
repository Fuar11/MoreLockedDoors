# More Locked Doors
This is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

More Locked Doors adds more locks to many of the game's buildings and doors, making certain key areas more inaccessible.

* More locks added on doors for key areas across Lower Great Bear like the Dam, Quonset Gas Station, etc...
* Locks require items like prybars, hacksaws and boltcutters to open.
* Added new item spawns for items to unlock doors with.

## Planned Features

* Even more locks to common locations around the world
* Keys and key spawns 

## Note for New Saves

* Using this mod on a new save will lock doors at random and may cause you to get stuck in certain locations.
